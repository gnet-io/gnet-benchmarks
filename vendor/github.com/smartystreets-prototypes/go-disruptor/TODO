- Rewrite all code test first (including diamond pattern)
- Squeeze little bits of performance here and there by trying a few different things
	e.g. pointers vs structs, padding, etc.
- Documentation
- Website with screenshots and examples
- Integration suite that can exercise the Disruptor code on:
  1. Multiple Go runtime versions, e.g. (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) (plus point releases and the latest tip)
  2. Multiple CPU architectures: ARM, i386, AMD64
  3. Multiple operation systems: Linux, OSX, Windows, etc.
  Ideally each of the above combinations would be an individual exercise
